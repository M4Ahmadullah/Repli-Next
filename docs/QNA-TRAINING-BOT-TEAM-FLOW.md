# Q&A Training Flow - Bot Team Implementation Guide

## Overview
We are implementing a comprehensive Q&A training system for AI bots. The frontend (Next.js) handles the UI and user interactions, while the bot team needs to implement the AI processing, document analysis, and intelligent question generation.

## Complete Flow Implementation

### Phase 1: Document Upload & Analysis

**Frontend Action:** User uploads a business document (PDF/DOC/DOCX, max 1MB)

**Bot Team Requirements:**
1. **Document Processing:**
   - Accept document upload via API endpoint
   - Parse and read the entire document content
   - Extract business information, services, and key details
   - Store document content securely

2. **AI Analysis:**
   - Analyze the document to understand the business
   - Extract business name, services, unique selling points
   - Identify key business processes and customer interactions
   - Generate comprehensive business understanding

3. **Response to Frontend:**
   ```json
   {
     "success": true,
     "aiSummary": {
       "businessUnderstanding": "I've analyzed your document and gained valuable insights about [Business Name]. I can see you're focused on [key services] with a strong emphasis on [unique aspects]. Your business appears to be well-structured with clear operational processes.",
       "keyInsights": [
         "Customer-focused approach",

     "message": "Document uploaded successfully"
   }
   ```

### Phase 2: Smart Question Generation

**Frontend Action:** User proceeds to Q&A section after document analysis

**Bot Team Requirements:**
1. **Intelligent Question Generation:**
   - Generate 5-7 smart questions about business aspects NOT mentioned in the document
   - Questions should be personalized based on the business type and document content
   - Focus on gaps in knowledge that would help the AI understand the business better
   - Questions should be specific, relevant, and actionable

2. **Question Types to Generate:**
   - Customer interaction patterns
   - Pricing and payment methods
   - Business hours and availability
   - Common customer questions and concerns
   - Unique selling propositions
   - Service delivery processes
   - Customer support procedures

3. **Response to Frontend:**
   ```json
   {
     "success": true,
     "questions": [
       "What are your business hours and how do customers typically reach you?",
       "What are the most common questions your customers ask before making a purchase?",
       "How do you handle customer complaints and what's your refund policy?",
       "What makes your business unique compared to competitors in your industry?",

     ],
     "aiSummary": {
       "businessUnderstanding": "Based on your uploaded document, I have a comprehensive understanding of your business operations. I can see you have well-defined processes and a strong customer focus. Your business appears to be well-established with clear service offerings and professional standards.",
       "keyInsights": [
         "Document-based insights available",
         "Structured business processes", 
         "Customer-centric approach",
         "Professional service delivery"
       ],
       "confidence": 92,
       "businessName": "[Business Name]"
     }
   }
   ```

### Phase 3: Answer Collection & Processing

**Frontend Action:** User adds custom FAQ pairs (optional)

**Bot Team Requirements:**
1. **Custom Q&A Processing:**
   - Accept custom question-answer pairs from user
   - Validate and store custom FAQs
   - Integrate with existing business knowledge
   - Ensure no conflicts with document-based knowledge

   ```json
   {
     "success": true,
     "customPairsStored": true,
     "totalCustomPairs": 3
   }
   ```

**Message for Bot Team:**

We are creating the Next.js frontend for the Q&A training wizard. You need to create the bot side that handles:

1. **Document Analysis:** Read and understand business documents completely
2. **Smart Question Generation:** Create 5-7 intelligent questions about business aspects not covered in the document
3. **Answer Processing:** Store answers and provide encouraging AI responses
4. **Custom Q&A Management:** Handle user-provided FAQ pairs
5. **Final Training:** Combine all information and create a business-aware AI bot

The bot should work as if the business is its master, with deep understanding of the business operations, customer interactions, and unique value propositions. The AI should provide personalized, accurate responses that reflect the business's tone, policies, and service standards.

Please implement the API endpoints and AI processing as outlined above. The frontend will handle all user interactions and UI, while your bot services will handle all the intelligent processing and AI responses.
